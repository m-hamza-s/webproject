            <p>Why do people visit Northern Areas of Pakistan? The sights and scenery. The one-of-a-kind events and world-class food. The welcoming people, the diversity and rich history. 
            <br><br>
            But perhaps, more importantly, it has to do with the fact that no other region is as adept at combining disparate elements to create something new: taking the familiar and marrying it to the unknown; merging people’s expectations to moments of unpredictability; uniting long-held notions with startling innovations.
            <br><br>
            Clearly, the attraction of Northern Areas is not any one thing, but the combination of many different things. As an organization, we see the city in its entirety — through the eyes of the people who live here, the people who love it and the people who love to come here.
            <br><br>
            And as proud as we are to help people arrange their visits to Northern Areas, we see our mission in even broader scope: We believe our true value lies not just in our ability to sell our city, but in our role as curators of the most interesting 49 square miles on the planet.
            <br><br>
            We are the OM Tourism Association. And we are the window into the City by the Bay.
